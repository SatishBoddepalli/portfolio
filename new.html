        <h3>Travel and tourism is the largest service industry in India..Lets have a look</h3>

      <p>Travel and tourism is the largest service industry in India. It provides heritage, cultural, medical, business and sports tourism. The main objective of this sector is to develop and promote tourism, maintain competitiveness of India as tourist destination and improve and expand existing tourism products to ensure employment generation and economic growth. In this section, we provide information about various tourist destinations, modes of travel, accommodation and approved travel agents.</p>
      <p>The concepts of travel and tourism are very closely linked, and both the travel industry and the tourism industry have significant overlap. However, there are also differences between the two terms and the two industries. In this article, you will find out more about both travel and tourism, and the industries based on those activities.</p>
      <p>Tourism is generally regarded as the act of travelling to a different location, for either business or pleasure purposes. However, it actually has quite a specific definition: the act of travelling to another environment, for at least 24 hours, but for no longer than one year, for purposes related to business or leisure.

        A tourist is generally only classed as such if they stay in overnight accommodation situated in the location they travel to. By its very nature, tourism involves a round trip, rather than travel in one direction only. With this in mind, the tourism industry refers to all aspects of the service industry that cater to tourists.</p>
        <p>Travel refers to the act of moving from one location to another. This can refer to long-distance travel, short-distance travel, overseas travel, domestic travel and various other forms. Crucially, travel also includes both round trips and one-way journeys, and it covers a wide variety of different travel purposes.

            The travel industry, therefore, refers to the numerous aspects of the wider service industry which cater for the needs and desires of those who have travelled from one part of the world to another.
            
            </p>
            <p>Given the definitions above, it is understandable that many people struggle to see much of a distinction between the tourism industry and the travel industry. Indeed, there is clearly significant overlap between the two, and many of the businesses and services that cater for tourists also cater for travellers more generally.

                Nevertheless, there are some notable differences. Essentially, the tourism industry is concerned with people travelling for business or pleasure purposes, staying in their destination for at least one night, and then returning. By contrast, the travel industry has a wider scope, covering more travel purposes and durations.</p>

        Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.[2] The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".[3]

        Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.
        
        Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,[4][5] but slowly recovered. Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (â‚¬740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010.[6] International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,[7] emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.[8] The ITB Berlin is the world's leading tourism trade-fair.[9][better source needed] Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.<br><br>
